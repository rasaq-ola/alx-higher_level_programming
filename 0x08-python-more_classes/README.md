## Description

This repository contains multiple Python files, each addressing a specific problem related to classes and objects. Below is a brief overview of each problem statement:

- **Simple Rectangle (`0-rectangle.py`):** Defines a simple empty Rectangle class.
- **Real Definition of a Rectangle (`1-rectangle.py`):** Defines a Rectangle class with properties for width and height.
- **Area and Perimeter (`2-rectangle.py`):** Extends the Rectangle class to include methods to calculate area and perimeter.
- **String Representation (`3-rectangle.py`):** Enhances the Rectangle class to provide string representations of objects.
- **Eval is Magic (`4-rectangle.py`):** Improves the Rectangle class to support `eval()` for object recreation.
- **Detect Instance Deletion (`5-rectangle.py`):** Adds functionality to detect and print a message when a Rectangle instance is deleted.
- **How Many Instances (`6-rectangle.py`):** Enhances the Rectangle class to track the number of instances created.
- **Change Representation (`7-rectangle.py`):** Adds a class attribute to change the print symbol for the Rectangle class.
- **Compare Rectangles (`8-rectangle.py`):** Adds a static method to compare rectangles based on their areas.
- **A Square is a Rectangle (`9-rectangle.py`):** Adds a class method to create a square Rectangle instance.

Additionally, the repository includes a solution to the N Queens problem (`101-nqueens.py`), which utilizes backtracking to solve the puzzle.
